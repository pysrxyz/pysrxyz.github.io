The data shows that minting activity started relatively modestly, with fewer tokens being minted in the initial hours. As time progressed, there was a marked increase in both the frequency and volume of minting transactions.

The Lorenz curve for Shitzu's token distribution post-minting paints a vivid picture of reward through engagement. Embracing the playful 'Proof of Finger' meme, the curve reflects a community-driven ethos where the most dedicated participants—the fervent clickers—are rewarded. The swift uptick at the curve's end signifies that those who believed in Shitzu's vision and acted upon it by frequently engaging with the minting process have amassed a greater share of the tokens.
